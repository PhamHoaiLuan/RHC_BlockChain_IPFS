# RHC_BlockChain_IPFS
Currently, the remote health care system seems no stranger to researchers who develop the healthcare based on IOT technology. Owing to the remote healthcare system based on IoT technology, there is a need for a third party, called cloud storage, to store all of the relevant information such as patient records, current patient situation, patient position. However, there have been numerous attacks on the cloud storage in order to steal important patient information then carrying out a series of illegal activities, thus requiring a new technology which can resolve the fatal weakness of IoT technology.
We have proposed the Remote Healthcare System using Blockchain Smart Contract and Decentralized Storage to address security and privacy issues as well as the storing issue of  body sensor parameters from patients. In more detail, medical records are stored directly in blockchain and use many policies to ensure that unauthorized users cannot access those data. In addition, the IPFS network was proposed to not only store the sensor parameters from the patient and ensure high security but also solve the huge problem of blockchain technology for storing IoT device data. Speaking of which, many people who know about IPFS networks will think that  a continuous data storage not feasible. I totally do not deny this statement, but a storing method for sensors was proposed, called "timestamp storage", to store continuous data.
